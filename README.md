# Train and Deploy Custom Object Detection Model 

This project demonstrates how you can train and create your custom model and deploy on Raspberry Pi to detect objects that are not present in the popular 
pre-trained Object Detection Models.

The training is done through a Colab notebook. Which is an interactive Python notebook accessible through a web browser.
The link of original notebook is :- 

the link of notebook I created from the original notebook:--

The notebook allows you to create a custom model using your data and download it.

The model I created is placed in the 'models/custom' folder. 

## detect.py

The python file 'detect.py' is capable of running the custom model or any other pre-trained model.
